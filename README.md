# AI Studio Project with Candogram

## Project Description

This project aims to address the challenge of ambiguous or fragmented job titles in "engineer" job postings by clustering the job descriptions based on the actual description sentences. For each cluster, a job title is assigned. The ultimate goal is to streamline the job search process for high school and college students. Candogram, which scrapes millions of job postings daily, breaks them down into several key categories, including job title. However, 60% of the job titles reviewed are too vague to categorize further. This project is currently in the phase of clustering, analyzing to generate job titles, and preparing for the final presentations in December. 

## Installation

The analysis can be viewed directly as the project progresses. Note that at some point, it will require an API key from OpenAI, which won't be made public.
